# Clue Media Experience

**Clue** is a free and open source environment, developed as fork of `LibreELEC`,
to provide you builtin functions like multimedia center, integrated webcam, multiple 
networking pre-configurations (like Repeater, Router, Hotspot,etc.), etc., everything 
out of the box, easy to be deployed and to use.

To install **Clue OS**  you have to download the installer image from [amsd.go.ro/clue](https://amsd.go.ro/clue),
choosing the right image file corresponding to your RPi version, write it on the SD 
(or min SD) card, and connect RPi device through LAN port to your local network. The 
installer doesn't require human interaction and it will finish the installation process 
in 1-2 minutes (depending by your RPi version).

After installation **Clue** system will boot loading automatically _Kodi_ media center 
graphical interface. Furthermore, level you'll have access over SSH using __root__ account 
(default password is `clue`) or over HTTP to control most of the system configurations.
Connecting the RPi device to a TV over _HDMI_ you'll be able to setup the system directly 
from TV remove control and also to control the entire _HDMI_ chain using **Setup** utility.

**Clue** works quite well on _RPi v2_ (it is suggested to not activate all services 
due to limited power processor) but it is recommended to run it on _RPi v3_ - it works 
like a charm on this hardware platform.

Enjoy!

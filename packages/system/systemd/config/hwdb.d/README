Hardware Database Files

The hwdb files are read from the files located in the system hwdb directory
/usr/lib/udev/hwdb.d and the user runtime directory /home/.config/hwdb.d
All hwdb files are collectively sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless of
the directories in which they live. However, files with identical filenames
replace each other. /usr/lib/udev/hwdb.d/* takes precedence over /home/.config/hwdb.d/*

your files must be named 99-xxxxx.hwdb
